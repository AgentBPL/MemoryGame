Application for Motorola Solutions.


Hello!!

I hope that all files are here. 
This is first time when I'm using GitHub.

I created the application in the other visual studio project. Then I watched how to add project to the GitHub. (My fault :( )
So I prepared GitHub repository and created new visual studio project in that location. Then I loaded .cs files from my first project.
